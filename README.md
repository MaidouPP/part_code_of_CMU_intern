# part_code_of_CMU_intern

This is part of the code of Tic-Tac-Toe I contribute to Tekkotsu platform.

Great experience in CMU. During my stay, I made improvement on object recognition, path planner and kinematic stuff. 

The ttt code is a demo for Camerabot, written in state machine form which uses state machine primitives of Tekkotsu software. I won't uploud the whole Tekkotsu project. It could be downloded from cvs which people could get from David Touretzky's personal website.
